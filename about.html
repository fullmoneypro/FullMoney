    <h2 style="margin-bottom:15px;">About FullMoney</h2>
  
    <p>
      FullMoney was created with a simple mission: to make financial knowledge accessible, practical, 
      and easy to understand for everyone. We believe that financial education is not a luxury — it is

      extra income, save money more effectively, start a business, or improve your financial mindset, 
      FullMoney provides clear guidance that helps you move in the right direction.
    </p>
  
    <p>
      Many people struggle with money not because they lack ambition or ability, but because they never

      or financial background.
